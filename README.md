# UDACITY_DATA_SCIENCE_NANO

**_These are the projects I completed as a part of the UDACITY Data Science Nano Degree_**



**Topic Modeling using LDA is in the folder MLProjects**
Used LDA Topic Models to extract Topics related to Nature Based Solutions addressing Climate Change. The data was extracted from several websites who are involved in NBS adaptation. Decription of all the text documents was used to derive Topics of dicussion under NbS using LDA Topic Models.  https://github.com/nishreenk/MLProjects/tree/main/LDA_Topic_Model

**Disaster Response Pipeline**

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. 

**Project Components**

1. ETL Pipeline

- Loads the messages and categories datasets

- Merges the two datasets

- Cleans the data

- Stores it in a SQLite database

2. ML Pipeline

- Loads data from the SQLite database

- Splits the dataset into training and test sets

- uilds a text processing and machine learning pipeline

- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV

- Outputs results on the test set

- Exports the final model as a pickle file

3. Flask Web App

- Data visualizations using Plotly in the Flask web app. 


**Data**
Pre-labeled tweets and text messages from a real-life disaster is provided by Figure8
The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. A machine learning pipeline categorizes these events so that one can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
