**Project Components**

1. ETL Pipeline

- Loads the messages and categories datasets

- Merges the two datasets

- Cleans the data

- Stores it in a SQLite database

2. ML Pipeline

- Loads data from the SQLite database

- Splits the dataset into training and test sets

- uilds a text processing and machine learning pipeline

- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV

- Outputs results on the test set

- Exports the final model as a pickle file

3. Flask Web App

- Data visualizations using Plotly in the Flask web app. 


**Data**
